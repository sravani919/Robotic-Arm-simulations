# Robotic-Arm-simulations
To model and simulate the forward and inverse kinematics of a 6-DOF robotic arm using PyBullet, performing a pick-and-place task. The task includes collecting and analyzing data on joint movements and end-effector positions, providing insights into the robot's performance.
